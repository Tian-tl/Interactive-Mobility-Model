# Interactive-Mobility-Model
In order to understand the logics that lead to the formulation of artificially intelligent cognitive and material systems, one first needs to understand the generative nature of
contemporary design models and their mathematical foundations. The intent of this module is to explore the logics and formal outputs of organizational behaviors. Through 
researching specific terminologies and finding exemplary projects in the fields of digital and interactive art, architecture and industrial design, the students will develop a 
formal language of interactive motion. 
This project is to achieve the goal of expanding and contracting space by using an assemblage module system. For more info, please click https://www.tian-lou.com/project-08
